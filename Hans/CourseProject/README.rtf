\

\b 1) Audio File Data Viewer
\b0 \
a. Open the following folder:\
     ./Hans/CourseProject/AudioFileDataViewer/WindowsFormsApplication2/bin/\
\
b. Run WindowsFormsApplication2.exe\
\
*Where is the source code?: \
- All of my source code is together in one file: ./Hans/CourseProject/AudioFileDataViewer/Form1.cs\
- All other files are generated by the visual studio IDE\
\
**The program will search the address specified in the text box at the bottom of the screen to load the data files.  Unfortunately, I did not upload them to gitHub yet so this programme won\'92t do much when you run it.\
\

\

\b 2) Audio Fingerprint Search
\b0 \
a. Open the following folder: \
    ./Hans/CourseProject/AudioFingerprintSearch/WindowsFormsApplication2/bin/\

\b0 \
a. This is a Mathematica file that pre-processes the audio files to get the local maxima of the spectrogram\
\
b. Open mathematica and run the script on any 2-channel .wav file\
\
*If you don\'92t have Mathematica but still want to run the script, SUTD IT dept supplies free copies of mathematica 8 }
