/*
	Skip List:
	program: each number (0-1000000) with an return as input
			-2 call for output the skiplist
			-1 call to exit the program
		one possible input can be as following:
			3
			5
			6
			2
			89
			45
			345
			35
			-2
			-1
	UNsolved problem:
		read input from standard input stream can be OK,
		BUT from other files, like redirect from other data files, does not work well. (e.g. $> ./sl < case.t > out.t)
		Don't know the reasons for now.

/* Problem Solved:
 * 	The problem occurs because everytime I run get_level()
 * 	I initialized a seed by time, which has the precisty to 
 * 	second.
 * 	When I read the input from keyboard, it is OK;
 * 	But if I read the input from File, it is too fast, and
 * 	time seed remains the same, so it can get the same value by rand()
 * 	As a result, the number on several next levels are similar...
