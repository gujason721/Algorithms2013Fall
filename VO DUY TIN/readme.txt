This package includes five C programs

1/ generatingfile:
	
	Create a file named "input.txt" in C drive that contains 2000 random numbers.

2/ insertion:

	Insertion sort algorithm

3/ merge:

	Merge sort algorithm

4/ heap:

	Heap sort algorithm

5/ quick:

	Quick sort algorithm

All four algorithms also have the same functions:

	- Read an input.txt file from C:\\input.txt and load all digits from the file to an array
	- Sort the array using one of above mentioned sorts 
	- Create an ouput.txt file into C:\\output.txt and write these sorted digits in this file
	- Print onto the terminal: 
		+ Sorting kind
		+ Total numbers containing in the input file
		+ Running time of programm
