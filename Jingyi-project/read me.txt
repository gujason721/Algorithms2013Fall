The code is composed of two parts.

The SVM part is a demo for sloving the problem of find maximum of an array. The main function is in Driver.java, you can simply execute it by run that java file. You'll get a approximative predicate by SVM which needs further furnishment, but it's ok, because the information we get is so near to what we want.

The AST part is for adding print statements in souce code. It's a java plugin project, so can simply run it by clicking F11. After that, a new IDE interface comes out with one button "sample command". Click the sample for the demo test find maximum project, it will add print statements in the demo source code.

If you have any questions running the code, please contact me at jingyi_wang@mymail.sutd.edu.sg
