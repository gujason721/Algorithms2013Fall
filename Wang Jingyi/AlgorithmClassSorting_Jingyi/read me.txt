The project implements four sort algorithms:
Heap sort;
Insert sort;
Merge sort;
Quick sort.

The arrays to be sorted are generated randomly each time. Also, you can set the array length and maximum number of the array to evaluate their performance.  

The run time of each algorithms are recorded in nanoseconds.
