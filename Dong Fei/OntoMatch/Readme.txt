The project is to partition a large-scale ontology into some scales. I choose two kinds of large ontology,
one is with 20 nodes and the other is with 30 nodes. The program can provide proper clusters and its average similarity.

Run Guide:
If you want to see the results of 20 nodes, just run the code.
If you want to see the results of 30 nodes, remember to modify the macro define of MaxNodeNum to 30, and cancel the comment of 
creating 30 nodes graph, then run the code.

In fact, it is also available to a graph with more nodes. Just modify some macro define and change the process of 
creating graph.
